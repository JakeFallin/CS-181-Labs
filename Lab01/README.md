# Lab 01



## Number 1

Convert a user provided (java.util.Scanner or program argument) binary string to an integer number (Output can be String and not necessarily java int primitive). Also write a method to convert integer to binary. (20 pts)
## Number 2

Write a program that will generate the longest common substring
(ignoring case) between two given input strings S1 and S2. For e.g.
if S1 = “racecar” and S2 = “carpool” the longest common substring
is “car”. There is a small twist to this problem, you are also
required to find the longest common substring when only S1 is 
reversed, only S2 is reversed, and when both are reversed. For e.g.
when both S1 and S2 are reversed S1 = “racecar” (omg!) and S2 =
“looprac” the longest common substring is “rac”. (15 pts)
For e.g. running java Lab02_yourname 2 racecar carpool should
return car car rac rac. (First output is for S1 and S2, second one is
when S1 is reversed, third is when S2 is reversed, and finally when
S1 and S2 are reversed)

## Number 3

We looked at 3n +1 conjecture in class on Monday Week 4. We
define a transformation function T(n) = 3n +1 when n is odd and
T(n) = n /2 when n is even. We saw that the conjecture states that
for any value of n, T(n) converges to 1. We also saw why there is
no actual proof for it and why this is an open problem. Write a
program that will generate a string of all values generated from
the function till it converges to 1. (15 pts)
For e.g. running java Lab02_yourname 3 7 returns “22 11 34 17 52
26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1”.
Note – You are required to use while, do while or for loops.
