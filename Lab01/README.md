# Lab 01



## Number 1

Convert a user provided (java.util.Scanner or program argument) binary string to an integer number (Output can be String and not necessarily java int primitive). Also write a method to convert integer to binary. (20 pts) For e.g. if the user enters “b1010101010” the output in the console should be “i682” and vice versa. 

## Number 2

To compute the square root of a number in java we will need java.lang.Math and then call the function Math.sqrt(num). The argument to this function is the number (num) for which we need to compute the square root. Can you write a method to compute the square root of a number correct to 10 decimal places, without using Math.sqrt()? (15 pts) Hint: Use numerical methods such as Newton’s method (a.k.a Newton-Raphson method)  

## Number 3

I have always wanted to create a function that will compute the roots of a quadratic function. I will like to have a program that takes the coefficients a, b, and c for the quadratic equation ax2+bx+ c = 0 and compute its roots r1 and r2. (15 pts) Hint – Use the approach provided here
